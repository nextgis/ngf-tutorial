# M. React NGW Map with Leaflet and Webpack

Explore advanced geospatial data visualization using React, Leaflet, and the NextGIS Frontend (NGF) libraries, all bundled with webpack.

## Theory

This tutorial demonstrates the use of the `@nextgis/react-ngw-leaflet` package to create a dynamic and interactive web map in a React application.
It covers advanced techniques such as drawing bezier curves between points, adding arrowheads, and manipulating GeoJSON data.
The application is bundled using webpack, illustrating a modern approach to building sophisticated web mapping solutions.

## Practice

- Set up a React application with NGW Leaflet integration using @nextgis/react-ngw-leaflet.
- Fetch and process geospatial data to create custom visualizations on the map.
- Learn advanced techniques in handling GeoJSON data, including creating bezier curves and arrowheads between points.
- Understand the webpack configuration for bundling a React application with NGW Leaflet.

This tutorial assumes the use of webpack for bundling the React application.
Ensure that your webpack configuration is set up to handle the requirements of this project, including transpiling JavaScript (Babel), processing CSS, and bundling React components.

To run this example, you need to execute these commands in the terminal:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```
